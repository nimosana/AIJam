# Karaoke & cookies
## Nicolas Morales-Sanabria

Face features have been replaced for images, now drawn depending on the size/angle of the face features for a more realistic effect. The mouth notably uses facemesh data to display different images depending on how open it is and where it's facing, to interpret and animate its movement. Eyes are rainbow, and cookies fall from the sky! A music playlist starts along with facemesh, to incite the user to karaoke and play with the mouth effect, eating cookies along the way. The user can control the music and the playlist for an enjoyable moment! For the project, I created a library (p5.playlistPlayer.js) which allows for the music and playlist controls featured.
